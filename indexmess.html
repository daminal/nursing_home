				<p>The nursing assistant is said to be the eyes and ears of the nurse. In the process of taking the time to assist a patient with basic activities of daily living, it is the nursing assistant who gets to know the patient best. Having worked in many nursing homes as an agency CNA, I have seen some very bad homes and some very good homes. </p>

		<h2>Where Do I Start?</h2>
		<div class="body">
			<h3>Picking a nursing home can be a compromise between cost, availability, distance, and quality.</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Distance: the easiest way to start is with an online search to rank the facilities by distance. I recommend searching &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; in <a href = "maps.google.com"> google maps.</a></li>
				<li>Cost: all you need to do if you will be paying with medicaid is call to make sure the facility takes medicaid. </li>
				<li>Availability: homes with a long waiting list may have a lot to offer in terms of quality care or great location. If you want to wait, you may want to talk to your loved one's doctor about a timeframe.</li>
				<li>Quality: If you know people who regularly visit a loved one in a facility, ask them how responsive the staff are to residents' needs. Also, you may want to give nonprofit homes special consideration. Although not all nonprofits offer quality care, some are especially service-oriented. Conversely, some of the worst homes I've seen are owned by large corporations. Your best resource is probably your nearest hospital's social worker. They should be very familiar with the homes in your area. </li>

		<h2>The Visit</h2>
		<div class="body">
			<h3>Scheduling your visit</h3>
			<p>Schedule a visit in the middle of a staff shift. Most homes switch staff at 7am and 3pm. Even in low-quality facilities, staff have to avoid leaving a mess for the next shift. The middle of the shift is more telling. </p>
			<h3>Leave the first floor</h3>
			<p>When you take a tour of a home, they'll want to show you the first floor. This is their showcase for the public. Once you see this, ask to be taken to the top floor for a tour as well.</p>

			<h3>Do the sniff test</h3>
			<p>As you enter a hallway, do the sniff test: if it stinks, it's probably unchanged diapers due to understaffing. In well run facilities, a smelly floor is usually considered a disgrace and the staff will address the odor immediately. </p>
			<h3>Sit in at a meal</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Does the food look appetizing, and do residents get a choice of what to eat?</li>
				<li>Are residents who are unable to feed themselves assisted until they stop eating the food presented to them?</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Check out their activities</h3>
			<p>Activities animate residents by prompting them to connect with each other and with their environment. To combat loneliness, dementia and depression, quality nursing homes offer activities several times per week. During your first visit, ask to see their activities calendar. Later, call and ask to schedule a second visit just before the time of an activity. Don't let the nursing home know you'd like to sit in on an activity until you are already there. </p>
			<h3>Here's what to look for:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Before the activity, CNAs go room to room to get residents excited about going.</li>
				<li>While escorting residents with limited mobility, the aid's attention is on talking with the resident</li>
				<li>Those with limited ability to participate are assisted patiently by a helper. </li>
				<li>The activities leader knows the participants and challenges each to participate to the level of their ability.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Warning Signs</h2>
		<div class="body">
			<h3>An adjustable bed backed into a corner</h3>
			<p>Both sides of the bed should be accessible. Putting one side of the bed against a wall is done in some facilities to make the room look home-like but in practice it makes rolling the patient prohibitively difficult. This can lead to neglected diaper changes, skin breakdown, and life-threatening illness. </p>
			<h3>Call buttons out of reach</h3>
			<p>State law requires that every patient have a call bell within reach when in their room. Staff may make the button inaccessible to a resident that they want to ignore. This is a sign of neglect. </p>
			<h3>Resident activities are few or are poorly attended</h3>
			<p>When it comes to providing activities, it only takes a small amount of resources for a facility to make a meaningful difference in residents' lives. If the home is not willing to take advantage of this opportunity, you need to wonder what duties they skimp on when no one's watching. </p>
			<h3>Dirty water</h3>
			<p>Ask to see the ice cooler and look at the ice scoop. It should not be sitting in stagnant water. </p>

		<h2>Abuse or Neglect</h2>
		<div class="body">
			<h3>Annual report cards </h3>
			<p>In the US, Medicare makes regular inspections of nursing homes, then gives each home a grade. Go <a href= "https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html">here</a> and enter your zip code to see how the homes in your area measure up to state and national averages.</p>
			<h3>Reporting a home</h3>
			<p>If you witness abuse or neglect, make a note of all the details, especially the time, location within the home, and if possible, the names of the staff involved. Then go to the Department of Health and Human Services' <a href= "http://www.ncea.aoa.gov/Stop_Abuse/Get_Help/State/index.aspx"> National Center on Elder Abuse page</a> to learn how to file a report in your state.</p>
