			<p>Picking a nursing home is an important but often daunting experience. Sure, a facility may <em>look</em> good when you take a tour, but what's it like when no one's watching? From my experiences as a volunteer and as an agency aide in tens of facilities, I have seen differences in quality that are like night and day. I want to share some tell-tale signs to watch for. With these tips in mind, you will get a better feel as you are touring a facility for how your loved one might feel living there.</p>

		<h2>Where Do I Start?</h2>
		<div class="body">
			Picking a nursing home can be a compromise between cost, availability, distance, and quality.
			<h3>Make a list and take notes.</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Distance: The simplest way to start is with an online search that ranks facilities by distance. I recommend searching &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; in <a href = "https://www.google.com/maps" target="_blank"> Google Maps</a>. Remember that even if a longer drive is less convenient for you, it could make a big difference in quality of care for your loved one.
				<li>Cost: If Medicaid or other insurance is paying, you just need to call to make sure the facility accepts it. Otherwise, you will need an idea of whether you want a private room and whether you'll be self-paying for physical, occupational, or other therapy.</li>
				<li>Availability: Factilities with a long waiting list may have a lot to offer in terms of quality care or great location. If your top picks have no open, talk to your loved one's doctor about how long it might okay to wait for one to open up.</li>
				<li>Quality: In any community, the person with the broadest knowledge about the quality of nursing homes is probably the hospital social worker. If you know people who regularly visit a loved one in a facility, ask them how responsive the staff are to residents' needs. Also keep in mind that some nonprofits offer excellent care. The difference between them and for-profit corporations can be night and day. </li>

		<h2>The Visit</h2>
		<div class="body">
			You will need to schedule a visit. Your tour guide's role is to present the home in the best possible light, but your role can be to see for yourself. 
			<h3>Scheduling your visit</h3>
				<p>Schedule a visit in the middle of a shift. Most homes switch staff at 7am and 3pm. Even in low-quality facilities, staff usually avoid leaving a mess for the next shift. The middle of the shift is more telling. </p>
			<h3>Leave the first floor</h3>
				<p>When you take a tour of a home, they'll want to show you the first floor. This is their showcase for the public. Once you see this, ask to be taken to the top floor for a tour as well.</p>
			<h3>Observe chatter</h3>
				<p>When a facility chronically understaffs, the staff reduce their social interaction with residents. What you want to see is that staff interact with patients at least as much as they do with each other. Also pay attention to whether they take the time to check in with how the resident is feeling and listen attentively. </p>
			<!--<h3>Do the sniff test</h3>
				<p>As you enter a hallway, do the sniff test: if it stinks, it's probably unchanged diapers due to understaffing. In well run facilities, a smelly floor is usually considered a disgrace and the staff will address the odor immediately. -->
			<h3>Sit in at a meal</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Does the food look appetizing, and do residents get a choice of what to eat?</li>
				<li>Are residents who are unable to feed themselves assisted until they stop eating the food presented to them?</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Check out their activities</h3>
				<p>Activities stimulate residents by prompting them to connect with each other and with their environment. To combat loneliness, dementia and depression, quality nursing homes offer activities several times per week. During your first visit, ask to see their activities calendar. Later, call and ask to schedule a second visit just before the time of an activity. Don't let the nursing home know you'd like to sit in on an activity until you are already there. </p>
			<h3>Here's what to look for:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Before the activity, CNAs go room to room to get residents excited about going.</li>
				<li>While escorting residents with limited mobility, the aid's attention is on talking with the resident</li>
				<li>Those with limited ability to participate are assisted patiently by a helper. </li>
				<li>The activities leader knows the participants and challenges each to participate to the level of their ability.</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Warning Signs</h2>
		<div class="body">
			These subtle signs suggest a facility cannot be trusted.
			<h3>An adjustable bed backed into a corner</h3>
				<p>Both sides of the bed should be accessible. Putting one side of the bed against a wall is done in some facilities to make the room look home-like but in practice it makes rolling the patient prohibitively difficult. This can lead to neglected diaper changes, skin breakdown, and life-threatening illness. </p>
			<h3>Call buttons out of reach</h3>
				<p>State law requires that every patient have a call bell within reach when in their room. Staff may make the button inaccessible to a resident that they want to ignore. This is a sign of neglect. </p>
			<h3>Resident activities are few or are poorly attended</h3>
				<p>When it comes to providing activities, it only takes a small amount of resources for a facility to make a meaningful difference in residents' lives. If the home is not willing to take advantage of this opportunity, you need to wonder what duties they skimp on when no one's watching. </p>
			<h3>Empty linen cart</h3>
				<p>Take a peek at the linen supply later in the shift. It's usually found in a cart that has shelves. If they're out of washcloths, towels, flat sheets, or top sheets, it's fair to question whether essential care is being provided. </p>
			<h3>Unanswered call bells</h3>
				<p>Every facility gets busy sometimes, but the good ones adjust by providing adequate staffing and by creating a culture of teamwork. Notice how many call bells are on at once in a wing and for how long. If more than one is on for more than five minutes, in an optimal environment you will not see staff within earshot socializing with each other. </p>

		<h2>Abuse or Neglect</h2>
		<div class="body">
			Because nursing homes are commonly tipped off days in advance of government inspections, a flawless report card must be viewed with some skepticism. Because facilities typically take less preaution when you visit, it's crucial that when you see something, you say something.
			<h3>Annual report cards </h3>
				<p>In the US, Medicare makes regular inspections of nursing homes, then gives each home a grade. Go <a href= "https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/search.html" target="_blank">here</a> and enter your zip code to see how the homes in your area measure up to state and national averages.</p>
			<h3>Reporting a home</h3>
				<p>If you witness abuse or neglect, make a note of all the details, especially the time, location within the home, and if possible, the names of the staff involved. Then go to the Department of Health and Human Services' <a href= "http://www.ncea.aoa.gov/Stop_Abuse/Get_Help/State/index.aspx" target="_blank"> National Center on Elder Abuse page</a> to learn how to file a report in your state.</p>
